Pay attention to coprights within all the files, they will be at the top.

Due to many copyright infringements I will not provide images and music which are on the SD card.
This is good news for you because now you're forced to customize the game a little!
(All the textures will still be in the game, because they are stored in ROM)
This will affect cutscenes and music.

I've written 'programs' to help with writing data onto an SD card in the format the game uses, they
can be found in my ES (Embedded Systems) repository.
